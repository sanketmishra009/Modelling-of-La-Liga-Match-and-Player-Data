# Modelling of La Liga Match and Player Data

This repository contains an analysis and modeling project focusing on match and player data from La Liga. The goal of the project is to uncover insights, perform predictive modeling, and showcase data-driven strategies related to football matches and player performance.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of La Liga match and player statistics.
- Data visualization to understand trends and patterns.
- Machine learning models for predicting match outcomes and player performance.
- Customizable parameters for different analytical objectives.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanketmishra009/Modelling-of-La-Liga-Match-and-Player-Data.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Modelling-of-La-Liga-Match-and-Player-Data
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Place your La Liga match and player data files in the `data/` directory.
2. Ensure the data is in CSV format and properly formatted for analysis.

### Running the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for step-by-step analysis and modeling.
2. Modify parameters as needed for your specific use case.

   Example:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
   ```

### Machine Learning Models

1. Train and evaluate predictive models by running the scripts in the `models/` directory.
2. Customize hyperparameters in the scripts for optimization.

## Results

- Insights into key match and player statistics.
- Predictive models for match outcomes and player performance.
- Visualizations highlighting trends and patterns in the data.
